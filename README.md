# SynthBrainGrow: Synthetic Diffusion Brain Aging for Longitudinal MRI Data Generation in Young People
This directory for the code for the paper "SynthBrainGrow: Synthetic Diffusion Brain Aging for Longitudinal MRI Data Generation in Young People" [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00682)

## Requirements
To run the example, you will need to install the [MONAI Generative Models package](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
```pip install monai-generative```

## Running the example
To run the example, you will need to run the Jupyter Notebook. This can be done by running the following command:

```jupyter notebook```

And open inference.ipynb in the browser.

## Work in progress
This repository is a work in progress.
[x] Add example notebook for inference
[] Add example notebook for training
[] Create Docker container for easy deployment
